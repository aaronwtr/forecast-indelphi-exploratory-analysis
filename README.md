# Interpreting DNA Damage Repair Outcome Predictors (DROPs)
This repository contains all the code used and developed to implement DROPs and explain them with the help of the [SHAP interpretability package]([https://pypi.org/project/shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)). 

The models that have been used in this research are [FORECasT](https://github.com/felicityallen/SelfTarget) and [Lindel](https://github.com/shendurelab/Lindel), both logistic regression-based CRISPR/Cas9 induced damage repair prediction models that predict the repair outcome distribution across different expected repair outcomes given a gRNA-target sequence.

The paper that resulted from this research can be found here: [INSERT PAPER LINK]
